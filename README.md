# Discord Minecraft Linker Bot V1 Alpha

This repository contains a Discord bot and a plugin that allow users to link their Minecraft accounts with Discord by verifying a secret key. The plugin provides a secure way to establish the link, and the bot handles the verification process. It is entirely written by me from scratch, so **it may present bugs.** ‚ùóCurrently, there is no measure whatsoever for handling SQL Injections! Use at your own risk!
## Installation

1. To ***compile*** the plugin from the Java source code, navigate to the `Java Plugin` folder and follow the build instructions provided:

2. In the `index.js` file, make the following configuration changes:
    - Replace `YOUR_DISCORD_BOT_TOKEN` with your Discord bot token.
    - Replace `YOUR_CLIENT_ID` with your bot's client ID.
    - Replace `YOUR_GUILD_ID` with your Discord guild (server) ID.

3. Set up a MySQL database, and configure the database connection details in the `index.js` file.
4. Configure the database connection details in the `main.java` file.

Here is how `your user_mapping` table should look like:
